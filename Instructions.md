# Instructions

I'm sharing below a take-home exercise that you can do with JS ideally. You
can share a public repo when you are done. Everything (!) will be judged by
our CTO when reviewing the exercise (code, repo structure, etc).
We want users to upload a badge: an avatar within a circle.

- Create a function taking a png as input and verifying that:
- Size = 512x512
- The only nontransparent pixels are within a circle
- The colors of the badge give a "happy" feeling
- You can also create a parallel function that converts the given image (of any format) into the specified object.
